<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The subject of this inquiry, tho’ of that importance
as to demand the care and attention of the ablest
writers, is perhaps the least understood of any
branch of science. This being in a great measure owing to
the present corrupt state of languages, and the wrong course
and direction of lexicographers in the investigation of them,
the Writer of this essay, therefore, without presuming to
instruct his readers in any common track of literature, only
submits to their perusal some discoveries, which perhaps may
be of service towards the restoration of language and primitive
knowledge, and excite the curiosity of those of greater learning
and penetration, and engage them, if possible, in a research
worthy of their contemplation, the restoration of the first
universal language of mankind. For although the ground-work,
which chiefly depends on the author’s own discoveries,
may be sketched out by himself, without the parts and learning
of an Aristotle, yet it must be confessed that the finishing
strokes in any new abstruse branches of literature deserve a
more masterly hand. However, since we are here indiscriminately
permitted a decent exercise of our faculties upon
the most serious subjects, it is to be hoped no unpardonable
offence has been committed, in submitting the following
sheets to the judgment and decision of men of candor and
learning. If they should in any degree approve of the writer’s
labours, he will then be justified this intrusion into the
province of the literati, with all his defects and inaccuracies.
But should the contrary happen after an impartial and candid
examination, he must then acquiesce with the common fate
of his fellow-labourers, and impute his errors or mistakes to
the intensity of his zeal for the service of mankind, more particularly
Britons of all denominations. But to be condemned
unheard, in a country that boasts so much of its liberties, especially
those of the press, must be without a precedent.</p>

<p>However customary it has been for writers to take
notice of the performances of former authors upon the like
subjects, in order to shew the necessity or utility of their
own; yet, as no person ever treated this subject upon the
present plan, and the author is not so vain as to imagine that
any thing he could have advanced might have been sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
to attract those that have been long accustomed to the
clod-cutting traces, and the voice of prejudice or mere
sounds, and he presumes not to teach any particular language
or doctrine, it shall be declined as useless in the present case;
and we shall proceed here to what seems to be more proper
and necessary for the illustration of the subject in hand, namely,
to transcribe some notes taken in the course of these inquiries,
introductory to a rational grammar. And first of the
nature and state of man.</p>

<p>Man, in the sense of language, is to be considered as a compound
of all beings, a microcosm in his form, and a general intelligent
echo of the divine fiat by his speech; a vegetable, by his
manner of growth and nourishment; an animal by his motion,
respiration, and feeling; and a spiritual being from his thinking
or intelligent faculties; his animal part being probably formed
with the other animals, out of the dust of the earth, and his
intelligence in its first state, that tree of life, breath, or superaddition
breathed into his nostrils by the creator, by which he became
a living soul. The essence of this celestial and terrestrial
system or compound being will probably remain indefinable,
until man shall recover his primitive existence, as the tree of
life; tho’ the tree of knowledge of good and evil in the
mean time furnish him with sufficient means for his happiness
here, and existence hereafter as the tree of life; for his organs
of sensation, in contact with external objects and impressions,
form in the sensory the various modes of feeling, and those
images are perceived by the will; which has not only a nilling
power of permitting those images to remain without any
additional light, as the mere images of sensation fit only for
the government of animal bodies; but also of willing or presenting
them to the reflecting faculty of the soul for the formation
of sentimental ideas, to be registered in the memory,
and employed by the mind in its intelligent, rational, wise
and virtuous operations, for the illumination and conduct of a
reasonable being, appointed by Providence lord of the
creation.</p>

<p>The human will being the sole energy of all voluntary
motions in man, and motions continuing in direct lines or
courses, if not diverted therefrom, most probably would have
continued its pure intuitive course and direction towards goodness,
virtue, and true happiness, without the power of nilling
or depravely contradicting its original nature, as the tree of
life, had not the serpent interposed and put the fruit of the
tree of knowledge of good and <i>evil</i> in its way. And as man
in his state of innocence, before his fall, must, as the tree or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
breath of life, have been furnished with the knowledge of
good, so it seems probable that Moses by the tree of
knowledge of good and <i>evil</i>, meant the generative powers,
or certain characters or letters representing them, engraved
on the <i>bark</i> of the tree of knowledge of good and evil,
furnishing the first pair, in their state of innocence, with two
sorts of ideas or knowledge, and the means of gratifying their
lust, as well as pride or curiosity of knowing good and evil,
like their superiors; mankind before their fall being probably
capable of seeing each others ideas, without the use of
sounds; and of propagation after the manner of the second
Adam.</p>

<p>Since those animals, which are endued with the organs
of speech, are incapable of articulating any conceptions, it
is reasonable to suppose that the animal part of man alone,
without the assistance of the intelligent or rational, must be
so likewise. It is therefore probable that the human will,
agreeable to the notes or ideas impressed on the memory, plays
upon the fibres, the simple tones of articulation; which in
their passage, with respiration, thro’ the lungs, stomach,
windpipe, larynx, and mouth, are by the glotis, tongue, lips,
muscles, and other organical powers, which assume literal
figures, modulated into articulate sounds, both simple and
compound, agreeable to the nature of things and their ideas,
as impressed in the human sensory. And as man is furnished
with ideas chiefly by the means of speech, the tree of knowledge
of good and evil seems to be no improper metaphor of
the human voice or <i>person</i>, or the Dryades and Hamadryades,
nor the tree of life, of man’s intuitive state of knowledge
and virtue.</p>

<p>It is yet the general opinion that human speech derives its
origin solely from the arbitrary composition or invention of
man, without any connexion with nature or the intervention
of Providence. However true such bold and presumptuous
doctrines may be with respect to some of the corrupt compounded
parts, which chiefly occasioned the great variety and
confusion of languages, yet articulate sounds, the materials
of speech, clearly appear to have been the gift of Providence,
and always the same in all countries; as for instance, an Indian,
as well as an European, in expressing the idea of
length, will contract and lengthen the organs of articulation,
so as to form an acute sound, and the shape of the letter i;
and to express breadth they will alike extend them, like the
letter o, to express a broad or grave sound; and so in other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
cases, though they differ as to the manner of compounding those
sounds; more especially on account of the great loss of primitives
amongst the Indians. And it cannot be otherwise, since
the scripture proves that Adam named things agreeable to their
nature, under the inspection and direction of Providence.</p>

<p>Again, to suppose man of himself, without the intervention
of Providence, capable of forming the materials of
his own speech, must be as absurd as to imagine that he
formed the materials of his own ideas or himself, since speech
depends on the original frame of man, and the shape of his
organs, and abstract and complex ideas on names, as the
means of forming and registering them in the memory. Nor
does it appear to be less so, to imagine dumb men, without
inspiration, capable of fixing upon arbitrary signs of language,
or advancing in knowledge, or at least, of forming so perfect
a system, without being previously taught the use of letters
and characters, the elements and principles of languages;
more especially such of the sounds and figures, as were not
to be met with in any other parts of nature, and the unintuitive,
vicious, privative, and negative parts both of
knowledge and language, which depend on the hieroglyfic,
sacred, or <i>secret</i> characters. And, whatever may be the
disguise of arbitrary or corrupt dialects, they will all appear
upon due examination to derive their origin from the original
tree of knowledge; and was it not for the difference of climates,
constitutions, habits, manners, and other accidents,
which demand the aid of grammar, it seems probable, since
characters represent the figures of things, and letters, or natural
articulate sounds subsist in the very frame of man, the
very ideas causing vibrations in the speaker, are felt by the
hearer, and the elements of speech are universally the same,
that languages would naturally fall, or at least, like the
English, incline to their primitive universal state, and the same
combination and construction of particles into words and
sentences, if the particles of all languages were precisely defined
according to their primitive meaning; there being in
man an innate potency of recurring to, as well as an impotency
of erring or deviating from the original modes of speech,
as well as perceptions, and of becoming virtuous and vicious
by turns.</p>

<p>Languages, it is true, have been fluctuating, and in particular
the English; which was originally the Celtic or Phrygian,
brought by our ancestors, the Titans, in the first westward
migration, from the lesser Asia, thro’ Greece and Italy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
into ancient Celtica; and which on the arrival of the Romans
in Italy partook of the Greek dialects, and furnished the
Romans with a considerable part of the Latin tongue. Some
of the Aborigines of Italy, Spain, and Gaul, having afterwards
fled from the Roman yoke into Germany, without
their priests and druids, who had before retired into Britain,
their language as well as knowledge received an ebb,
though no foreign admixture. But their priests and bards
denominated in the writings of the British poets, the Luchlin
colony, and in Germany and Italy, by the names of Longobards,
and Lombards, <i>the great bard nation</i>, and speaking
the British language in Germany, being drove by the Romans
out of Britain, into Germany and Denmark, their
language as well as knowledge received some increase from
the mother tongue; which then in its turn began to sink in
Britain. And thus all the dialects of ancient Celtica are but
different dialects of the old Celtic language, which first made
its way into Europe, and so they ought to be deemed by lexicographers
in their definition of vocables. But of all those
dialects, the English in respect to the copiousness, strength,
and simplicity both of its vocables and construction, seems
to be the best fund for an universal language of any upon
earth.</p>

<p>It may not perhaps seem improper here to explain some
other abstruse principles in physics and metaphysics, from the
meaning of vocables, as they too seem to explain the principles
of rational grammar. There are, it seems, in physics,
discoverable by the signification of words, three universal
principles or genusses of things, namely, space, matter, and
motion; which, as to their essences, if essence, nature, and
quality differ in ought but form, are indefinable. But with
respect to their modes, properties, and forms, space is distance
every way, whether with or without body; with it, it is
extension or capacity; without it, a vacuum; quantity,
mensuration, number, place or matter extended, a continent,
an island, length, breadth, figure, thickness, an inch, a
foot, a yard and such things being its modes. Matter, whatever
its essence may be, is an indivisible impenetrable atom or
corpuscule; of which two or more assembled or cohered,
form a particle, and larger cohesions or combinations of those
form sensible bodies, which are chiefly distinguishable in language
by their forms; though they have such properties and
modes, as length, breadth, and thickness, or extension, solidity,
or an assemblage excluding all other bodies from its place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
divisibility or the separation of its quantity, mobility,
passiveness, and figure, or that length and breadth without
thickness, which present themselves to the eye. And as to
the active qualities of matter, they seem to be all intentional,
as fluidity, softness, rarity, heat, and other modes of motion;
all the rest being passive, and arising merely from the
different texture, disposition, and combination of bodies;
or a privation of the former; as, firmness, hardness, density,
coldness, dryness, and rest. Motion is the successive
passage or change from once place or state to another. Of
which there are three sorts expressible by language, viz. the
energic, generative, and local; which with their various
modes or actions are expressible by verbs.</p>

<p>The metaphysical part of man, which derives its origin
from the Creator’s impression, or the essence of the thinking
soul, altho’ it has no more consciousness or knowledge of its
own essence, than those of other beings; nor perhaps the
means of its present modes of conception, without the use of
those bodily organs, to which the all-wise Creator was pleased
to confine it for a time, and the presence of internal objects,
any more than the organs of sensation feel the touch without
the contact of external objects, is still in the fool, as well as
philosopher, when furnished with proper organs, equally
capable of that innate potency of expressing its own qualities
and actions, as is evident from our universal acknowledgement
of a creator, and the different powers of those fools who
are capable of lucid intervals. And however different our
reasonings may be concerning the attributes of the infinite
Creator, from the variousness of objects and different degrees
of volition, there can be nothing more absurd than to affirm
that the human soul cannot be impressed with the image of its
Creator, because at times it expresses or affects no consciousness
of it; consciousness being rather an energic affirmation
or quality of the soul, than its essence, as an involuntary animal
or vegetable motion is an act, rather than the cause of
motion. Such perceptions however as it does express of
spiritual beings, have privative, energic, or moral names;
which are formed by the symmetry, and just measures and
proportions of parts and modes of motion; from whence
moral notions also derive their origin, as shall be shewn in
the course of the following work, as shall also as to our mistaking
infinite duration for time.</p>

the <i>fallen</i> angel that tempted Eve, the name of di-afal or
devil, <i>the apple God</i>; and figes and vices signify the same
thing; the v consonant and digamma being the same, and
g being an inflection of the radical c. See <i>person</i>, <i>wood</i>, &amp;c.
in the vocabulary.</p>

<p>The fall of man has laid us under a sort of charm, which
nothing can remove but a thorough taste of the tree of knowledge,
and avoiding its vicious branches as much as possible.
Had that great reasoner Mr. Lock been so happy as to attend
a little more to the tree of knowledge, instead of intirely rejecting
the divine origin of human speech, and innate principles
of thinking, he might have reasoned well upon <i>right</i>
principles, instead of misleading and confirming us in our errors,
as without doubt was his intention.</p>

<p>The learned Hermes, the very best of modern grammarians,
whose ingenious performance, had it sooner come
to my perusal, might have charmed me out of my present labours,
to acquiesce with his opinions, seems to be a little affected
by this fort of charm, and perhaps is as much deluded
from his subject by the language, learning, and beauties of the
Greeks and Romans, as the late author of the short introduction
to the English language, by some of our modern
barbarisms, the very exceptionable parts of our language.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<h2>GRAMMAR.</h2>

<p>Grammar is the right method of expressing the ideas
of things by signs and sounds adapted for the sensation
of the eye and ear, according to their hieroglyfic
nature, forms, and modes, and that εντελεχεια or intelligent
echo, with which man was originally endued by his
Creator.</p>

<p>It consists of three parts or sorts of names, viz. letters,
considered as characters or the figures of things, and as signs
of articulate sounds; their combination into particles and
nouns; and their construction into phrases, propositions, and
sentences. And, according to the present state of languages,
etymology may be admitted as a fourth division of
grammar.</p>

<hr />

<h3>LETTERS.</h3>

<p>Letters, as γραμματα or characters, either really or emblematically
personate, and represent things and ideas; and
as notes of articulate sounds signify internal conceptions, and
express them to others. They consist of various sorts, such
as simple characters to denote elements or principles; compounds
to express complex ideas, and things; the dividers of
parts; actives, energies, and affirmatives; and privatives, and
negatives. These are the smallest or elementary parts of
language, as atoms are of matter and action of motion; an
assemblage thereof form particles, as of atoms do those of
matter; and a combination of either form more sensible bodies,
and so on to the construction of larger forms, masses or
sentences; letters having been formed in their shapes and sounds,
agreeable to ideas and things, and having a natural connection
therewith; and length and breadth affecting the eye
in the same manner as their vibrations do the ear, and
a combination of both the human will and perception.</p>

<p>Characters, which consist of irregular lines, circles, or
curves, are incapable of general signs or meanings, or representing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
many things; but strait lines, and circles, and their
division and multiplication, like the Roman, only are capable of
that hieroglyfic, universal representation and meaning, which
the first universal language must be supposed to express, and as
most other characters seem to be only deviations from the
Roman, from mere affectation, or for the conveniency of
sculpture, there seems to be no great absurdity in supposing
that Adam was furnished with <i>those</i> characters, and instructed
in their sounds; that they continued in general use until the
confusion of Babel, when mankind began to make use of the
noise or sounds of cattle instead of human voices; and that
the Romans were furnished with those characters by the
Tuscans on their arrival in Italy. Nor does it seem in the least
probable that those nations which had been destined by Providence
to be the possessors of the most distant countries westward
from Asia, who made their way thither accordingly, along
the Mediterranean coasts, through Crete, Greece, Sicily,
Egypt, Mauritania, Tuscany, Spain, Gaul, and Britain,
were in Asia at the time of the confusion. And as those
characters are adapted only for the Celtic, Phrygian, or
British language, which resolves the names of places of
the several countries through which it passed, preferable to
the more modern dialects thereof, and Cæsar thought that
Druidism began in Britain; it seems very probable that Mercury,
Gomer, or Hermes, and other Druids, leaders of the
western colonies, were always possest of those <i>secret</i> characters;
it being certain that the Gauls before Cæsar’s time
had the use of letters. Besides, ancient history takes notice
of the hieroglyfics, as consisting of the figures of animals,
parts of human bodies, and mechanical instruments invented
by Thoth the first Hermes, which were afterwards translated
into Greek, and deposited in books in the Egyptian
temples, and which the learned supposed to be sacred
characters.</p>

<p>The characters of the first language were without doubt
simple, requiring but few rules for their combination and
construction; and yet must have been expressive of all the natural
signs and sounds of things; for such certainly ought
to be the construction of a language proposed for an universal
assent; and such in my opinion is the English, whose vocables
are hieroglyfic; and their meaning agreeing with the picturesque
combination. These were the ancient characters, engravings,
or γραμματα; and their sounds were the στοιχα, <i>the
chief sounds</i>; and which we shall here proceed to explain, together
with the Greek characters.</p>

<p>This alphabet consists of seven vowels or voices, which in
their own nature, actively, and without any super-addition,
yield compleat articulate sounds, particles, or names, and
hieroglyfically represent the elementary or active parts of
the human body, and nature, as similar thereto, namely,
a, e or h, i, o, u, w or ω, Υ; and of other characters or
letters, which are called consonants from their yielding articulate
sounds only in company with vowels. Of these b, c, d,
f, g, l, m, p, t, are also hieroglyfic representations of the
various parts of the human body and other things as similar
thereto; and they are mutable and inflectory in the pronominal
cases, from the less animate, slow, and almost silent
radical state, both as to the sense and sound, to the rougher,
louder, and more animate and active sounds and things; as
for instance, c, p, τ, the most silent, as expressive of material
or passive substances or local inanimate actions inflect
into g, b, d, which are somewhat louder and rougher,
as being expressive of the higher and more active things and
actions of men and animals; and those again into the still
louder and rougher sounds of ch, ff, th, as those are expressive
of the most energic actions or modes of motion; but
when g, b, d, are the radicals of inflection, they again inflect into
ng, f, m, dd, n, and in some dialects the l and r have the
aspirates ll and rh for the radicals, as has been shewn in my
former treatises. To the loss of these inflections may in a
great measure be imputed the great variety and confusion of
languages; new dialects having been formed by changing the
radicals and misapplying the inflectories, as father for pater,
brother for frater, and mother for mater. b, c, d, j, k, p,
q, t, as yielding little or no sounds, without the assistance of
vowels, are called mutes; l, m, n, r, f, s, as having imperfect
obscure sounds without the company of vowels, have been
distinguished as semivowels; and l, m, n, r, also as liquids from
their flowing in particles, as in, îf, îl, îm, în, îr, the flow
of the sun’s rays, light, motion, liquid, and life or qualities
upon the lower world of beings and things; but the distinctions
of mutes and semivowels seem trifling, as most letters
seem to be vowels in some degree.</p>

<p>Here, before we proceed to explain the figures and powers
of letters, it may not perhaps be improper to observe that the
parts, affections, and ideas of the human pair, incorporated,
as in the figures at the end of this essay, were the
archetypes or patterns of the original characters, whose
figures and sounds are descriptive of the universe; that letters
and particles have two sounds, the masculine and feminine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the active and passive, or the short and long; that a particle
or syllable cannot in the genuine sense of language consist of
more than two letters; and that there are not in fact any such
things as dipthongs; those now supposed to be such, being
two or three particles of one vowel each, which formerly
was a common method of composition, as appears by the following
piece of ancient poetry; in which there is no consonant
made use of, the r being only a letter of sound.</p>

<p>The letter o is an indefinite circle, signifying the universe,
motion, space, the sun’s figure and motion, and all or ol,
extension of length, breadth, and thickness; and it is
expressible of parts only by a diminution of its general sense;
as in b-ol, a ball or part of all, or-b, a circle part, w-or-l-d,
a man’s circle part or place of life, b-or-d-er the circle part of
the possessions and 10, one circle, which being repeated
comprehends all numbers. This, like all other original letters,
has two sounds, the long and the short, as in <i>on</i>, <i>one</i>,
<i>ton</i>, <i>tone</i>; and its shape or figure was taken from the circumference
of the human pair close together, face to face, which
is man’s chief circle place, signified by the term <i>world</i>. The
Greek ω is a double υ as has been explained in my former
treatise.</p>

<p>The letter i is an indefinite line, representing man in his
primitive state of innocence, as it does still his body, as a
line, without its extension, and his head and senses by its
dot; and in a secondary sense are expressed by this line and
dot, length or heighth towards the sun, the sun-beams, fire,
heat, and other qualities both spiritual and animal, as still
flowing upon man, and other things as relative to him, and
originally perhaps centering in himself, and since his fall
only relatively. But though man and nature have been impaired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
by original sin, they still seem to be invested with certain
springs, energies, or returns of those ilations and qualities,
as, thinking, willing, voice articulate, powers generative
and growth; whereby the human species may be extended,
and acquire so much knowledge and virtue, as, with
the blessing of Providence, to be capable of being reinstated.
The chief of which springs is expressed by the letter u, a
compound of two i’s signifying man’s compound of male and
female, and spirit and matter, with a c at their bottom,
springing them upwards; by y as to the generative and vegetative
parts, which also is expressive of woods and other
growth; it being a compound of i j, and half of the spring c,
as not being expressive of the spirit of man. The i also expresses
man as an upright line placed in the centre of all
worldly beings and substances, to whom they bear a relation,
as shall be shewn under adverbs. The u vowel seems to derive
its figure from the human face, the seat of the voice, and
the heart, and the feminine or consonant v from the vagina,
if it be an original letter, but, from its sound, it seems to
supply the place of the digamma. The y or Υ resembles trees,
plants and vegetables, and the j consonant is the half of it, and
sometimes made use of instead of g, to express some of the
generative parts and qualities. These vowels have each two
sounds, the high and low, long and short, or grave and
acute, viz. i, as in, <i>in</i>, <i>high</i>, or <i>i</i>, go thou; the u vowel,
as, in, <i>unction</i>, <i>united</i>; and the y as the u in unction and y in
hyssop; but the w has only one long sound, as in <i>woman</i>,
<i>womb</i>, <i>wood</i>, and it is mostly applicable to spirituals, man,
and things belonging to him; the wh has the gutteral sound
of the Welsh ch, or the Greek χ as in <i>where</i>, <i>why</i>; the j
consonant has the sound of g in <i>generation</i>; and the v consonant
that of the soft flowing f of the Welsh, or as in <i>verb</i>,
<i>vice</i>; thus supplying the softer sound and meaning of the
digamma.</p>

<p>The letters a, e, h, ε, η, Η, in their primary sense signify the
male and female posteriors, the clitoris, erectores, &amp;c. the impulse
and springs of generation, and the earth and water place of
man; whence a came to be an expression for the element
earth or matter and things hard, rough, or interjectory, and
ε for the element of water and any feminine, soft, or passive
parts or things, but the interjectory aspirate e or <i>he</i> is
masculine, and the ε has one spring resembling that of
rain. The a has properly two sounds, as in <i>animal</i>, <i>have</i>,
or <i>name</i>, but not that of o or the northern a in <i>all</i>; the masculine
e or he has an aspirate sound, as in <i>hero</i>, and a mute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
one, as in <i>echo</i>; and the feminine ε was originally sounded
soft, like the French cedill ç, as in <i>fleece</i>, <i>vice</i>, and the use of
this character and sound ought to be continued or the soft c
should be marked with a cedill to prevent the confusion
of the hard and soft sounds of c; but more of this elsewhere.</p>

<p>The letters c, k, q, g, γ, wh, ch, κ, χ, Ξ, ξ signify
actions of different sorts and degrees, viz. c as the half of o,
signifying motion, and k and q, as significant of its sound,
signify the modes of common local motions or actions; and
the hard c also represents half the round of the posteriors, as
o doth the whole of the male and female together, as the
feminine or soft c doth the other half; g or γ represent the
testicles or half the gamma, f being the other half, and the generative
and growing parts of man and nature; and the rest
are their gutteral inflections expressive of animal sounds and
actions. The palatals should be sounded hard and short, as
in <i>quick</i>, the soft c in some cases as the feminine ε before explained,
and s before the vowel i, the superlative gutteral
sorts, as the wh in <i>where</i>, <i>why</i>, and the Welsh <i>chwa</i>, <i>chwant</i>,
and g or γ as in <i>egg</i>, <i>edge</i>. All these characters are nothing
more than compounds of c, h, s, as will be shewn hereafter.</p>

<p>The letters d and b put together, thus, db, as compounds of
i and o, or length and breadth, are expressive of man and
woman’s body part, from the thigh to the part of the body
which the elbow reaches, and all other living beings so extended,
as τ does the extension of matter, but being again
divided into d and b, they express living things, or the qualities
of parts and diminutives of bodies, and emblematically
spirits and privatives, as p does parts of matter, as divisor of
τ. The d and b ought to be sounded alike in all languages,
as, <i>de</i>, <i>be</i>, and dd, as <i>the</i>, but letters are farther explained in
the former treatise.</p>

<p>T represents man’s legs together, with the feet upwards,
and both toes turned outwards as upright and traverse lines,
extension and man in his temporal state, turned out of paradise,
under the sky, topsy turvy, and all things as relative to
him, and the line upon which time or the manner of reckoning
the distances of actions are measured. T sounds alike in
all languages, and th and θ as in <i>the</i>, <i>Thebes</i>, and those are
the inflections of T.</p>

<p>The letters p, ph, ff, f, π, φ, ψ, signify material or
dead parts, or their qualities, as p divides T; ph is p high,
up, or active; the digamma φ or f, the p inflecting the
gamma; and ψ actions of a lesser nature, as growth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
The p and π sound alike in all languages, ph, ff as φυω,
<i>fusee</i>, or <i>fun</i>, ψ as in <i>Psalms</i>, it being only a compound of p,
and f as the v consonant in <i>verb</i>, but these letters are farther
explained in the former treatise.</p>

<p><i>m</i> represents a man’s body and arms or wings from the
top of b and d, or the elbow part of the body, up to the neck,
and the world, forms, and things, as surrounding and belonging
to man, as shall be further explained amongst the particles.
It sounds the same in all languages. <i>n</i> is the thighs,
with the parts above them, forming a traverse line, and the
vacancy betwixt the same when extended, signifying to be in,
or in existence or possession, having f and d for its auxiliaries,
but before the vowels or springs it expresses a negative or privative;
and it has no particular sound.</p>

<p>Ỻ, L, λ, are T or man’s legs, once put together, separated,
and as divisors of T, which signifies space or extension,
are expressive of particular lengths and breadths, and their
places, qualities, &amp;c. The L or λ is sounded as eel or îl
and Ỻ has an aspirate hissing sound in the Welsh, Spanish,
and some other dialects.</p>

<p>The letters r, ϱ, ρ, Ρ, R, represent animals and their parts,
and their mouths as the place of sound; S being added to P, as
a sound, forms R, the sound as well as part of an animal; and
they are all to be sounded as in <i>viper</i>, except where they happen
to be radical letters, and then with an aspirate h as in
<i>rhyme</i>. The S, σ, Z, are also letters of sound, but express
no part of man, and are rather the shape of some animal
of the serpentine kind, the waving of the breath or
water, &amp;c. They have two sounds, the hard and soft, as
in <i>loss</i>, <i>zone</i>. This explanation of letters, together with
what has been given already in my former treatises, and shall
be added amongst the particles, will, it is to be hoped, be
deemed satisfactory, as to the sense and origin of letters, and
the sacred characters; notwithstanding the pretensions lately
set up for those of irregular lines, curves, and windings,
which can express but few things, and the remarks of another
ingenious gentleman, as to the non-entity or insignificancy
of the Hieroglyfics; his enquiry having been confined to the
vulgar sorts, or the paintings or engravings of animals, &amp;c.
when it now appears the Hieroglyfics consisted only of those
few sacred or <i>secret</i> characters. The hints and specimens here
given of the method of combining the hieroglyfic figures,
being as compleat as the press will admit of; and a process
thereof, thro’ the whole of the English language, considering
the corrupt state of languages, tho’ the English is as capable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
of an hieroglyfic combination as any, requiring much loss of
time, trouble, and expence, and perhaps the aid of a Hunter
and a Hill, and some other reasons occurring, the author hopes
he shall be excused for proceeding no further at the present,
in the combination of characters.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Of Particles and Syllables.</h3>

<p>A Particle is a simple articulate sound and sign of one
or two characters or letters; but a syllable sometimes
by the cutting off of vowels, becomes a combination
of more letters, which is yet commonly pronounced
as a simple articulate sound; there being a natural relation
and agreement betwixt the signs and sounds of letters, and
ideas and things. Particles and syllables were originally framed
according to their hieroglyfic shape, the natural sounds of
ideas and things, and the sense and value of letters, as has
been already explained; and therein the quantity of the
action of sound was measured and proportioned to the motion,
action, or energy of the thing to be expressed, as the high,
loud, acute, or short accent, for an active or energic particle,
and the low, grave, and long, for a passive, substantive,
or a negative one.</p>

<p>And altho’ some letters, as a, e, y, p, t, and some particles
in words are so fixed by the addition of y, ty, ive, and
other terminations, as of themselves to be always substantive
and long, as to quantity and accent; yet those passive and
long letters and particles, by the addition of an active vowel,
consonant, or particle, will become active and short. Hence
the best way of spelling or pronouncing must be to divide the
particles of compound names according to the original manner
of their combination, sense, and sounds, and when a vowel
is cut off, its consonant, with the remaining vowel, or with
the most valuable, if there should be any doubt, as in the
following examples, ex-ec-ra-ble, co-re-spond-ing, pro-ble-m-at-ic-al-ly,
un-ec-spect-ed-ly, prin-ce, o-af, o-ther, o-ver,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
ub-iqu-i-ty. Those sorts of names and their compounds according
to their significations and nature in language, are
distinguishable into the following sorts, viz. Articles to substantive
and identify names; nouns substantive, or the names
of substances; pronouns, which collectively express nouns
and antecedent parts of sentences; adjectives, which are
added to the names of substances, to express their qualities
and accidents; actives, or the names of actions, verbs, energies,
and affirmatives of being, acting, and feeling; adverbs
or additional words, to express quantities, qualities, distances,
modes, and energies of actions and things, with their degrees;
prepositions to denote and connect situations, and
conjunctions or connectives of names, proportions, and sentences.</p>

<p>As the right apprehension of the hieroglyfic primitive language
very much depends on a clear illustration of particles,
which as sorts of compound letters, together with the primitive
hieroglyfic letters, comprehend all the materials of the first
universal language, the following addition is here made to
what has been already published on the etymology of particles;
the radicals being placed in each class before their inflections
and transponents. Ab, eb, af, ef; ba, be, fa, fe. These express
the generas and species, as well as causes and effects
of animal life, beings, and growth of the earth and water,
both male and female, as in ab-ba, eb-riety, af-ect, ef-ect,
ba-by, be-an, fa-ther, fe-male, fa-ar-am-er, ba-ar-en-ess.</p>

<p>Ib, if, bi, fi. These are expressive of the qualities flowing
from above, like the sun’s rays upon man and inferior
beings, and their return of life, as in l-ib-eral, l-îf, bi-le,
fi-eld.</p>

<p>Ub, uf, bu, fu. These are the springs or returns of
the above qualities in man and other beings, as in ub-erty,
h-uf, bu-d, fu-el, ub or springing upwards.</p>

<p>Ob, of, bo, fo. These signify out of, or from the circle
of life or sight, or dead, as in ob-lation, ob-livion, of-fering,
of, bo-dy, bo-ne, fo-reign.</p>

<p>Ac, ec, ag, eg, ach, ech, ang, eng, ca, ce, ga, ge, cha,
che, nga, nge. The first sort of particles denote the several
motions and actions of earth and water or matter, both
animate and inanimate, and their transponents express their
contraries, such as, rest, confinement, shuts or inclosures, as
in, ac-t, ec-stacy, ec-ho, ag-ain, eg-g, ach-ieve, ach-os
or cause, spe-ech, bre-ech, ech-uin or a loan, ang-er,
eng-age, ca-ab-age, ca-ge, ce-iling, ce-ll, ke-ep, ga-te,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
ge-ld, cha-os, che-st, che-fn or her back, gnad or gned, or
finished, kna-ve, kne-ad.</p>

<p>Ic, ig, ich, ing, ci, gi, chi, ngi. These are the principles,
qualities, and beginning of motion, the first or chief
action, or creation of heat, man, and things, and their returns,
as in h-ic, or the man action, ig-menos or proceeded,
ig-neous, h-igh, wh-ich, ich-od, ing or acting, as a man in
the line of possession, th-ing, k-ing or ci-ing, the chief in the
line of possession, the rest are the inflections of ci or chief
inflected thus, ci, <i>a chief</i>, gi, <i>his chief</i>, chi, <i>her chief</i>, ngi,
<i>my chief</i>.</p>

<p>Uc, ug, uch, ung, cu, qu, chu, ngu. These are the
springs or returns of those acts from man and other beings
upwards, and the species of generations, productions, and
energies therefrom, as in uc, uc’s-or, cl-uck, h-ung, ug-ly,
ug-ies, uch-el, cu-san or kiss, cu-r or care, cu-b, Cu-pid,
gu-ide, gu-ilt, gu-st, gu-t, chuck, chu-rl, chu-ith or breath,
know-ledge, gnu-eid or making.</p>

<p>Oc, og, och, ong, co, go, cho, ngo. These are the
most occult actions as proceeding from the hind part of the
human circle, or from the sight part of the circle, occurrences,
and coalescence of actions and motions circular, and
their species and productions, as in oc-ult, oc-currence,
og-le, och-i-my or filth to me, och or oh fie, th-ong,
co-alescence, co-herence, go-re, cho-ler, ngo or my memory.</p>

<p>Ad, add, ed, edd, da, dda, de, dde. These are expressive of
diminution, privation and division of earth, water, matter,
growth, parts, and other things; and as such an addition to
the goods and possessions of man, as in add, ad-eg or de-crease,
had or seed, ed-ible, da or goods, dda his goods,

îl-um-ine, ho-îl the sun or the glorious light, h-îl, its flowing
rays and the human race, li-ght, li-u or colou-r, li-ke, or

from, ap-erture, pa what part, pe-th or pa-rt, ep, ef, or
eph, privatives and used as terminations as parts of water, as
are op and oph; it being absurd to suppose O all to be a part,
or ip, up, or ub, which imply no extension and are springs
upwards, to be divisible. See the Postscript.</p>

thereof; us and iu, the human, sweet, or persuasive
sound or person.</p>

things, as in hot, oth, from thy possession, to, top, to-il,
to-parch, tho, tho-rough, tho-ught.</p>

<p>Ou is woe or a man out of the circle of life; and <span class="smcapuc">UU</span> or w
is the spring of springs.</p>

<p>Of those sorts of names are formed the more complex, such
as those names, phrases, or propositions called words merely
by a combination of the proper sorts, either with or without an
elision of consonants. In the latter case, the less expressive,
valuable, or necessary may be cut off when two vowels occur
in composition, as its consonant will in some measure preserve
its sound in company with a more worthy vowel; and
all active radical vowels ought to be dropped in the names of
substances and things, as appears by the following examples,
viz. blackish or b-li-ack-ish, <i>a thing without light</i>; blessedness
or bi-il-ess-ed-in-ess, <i>life flowing down upon the world</i>;
brutish, or ab-ru-ti-ish, <i>he is from the property of truth</i>; clamorous
or ac-al-am-or-us, <i>a great calling action about us</i>; cliverly,
or ci-liv-erly, <i>like the water clan</i>; creating or ac-ci-ir-at-ing,
<i>the chief or first motion to extension and action</i>; crocodile or
ac-ir-oc-o-di-il, <i>an angry acting, deceitful water animal</i>; dread
or id-ir-ad, <i>at the fire</i>; flow or af-il-ow, <i>a spring of the rays of the
sun</i>; frost or af-oer-st, <i>the lower parts at a stand from the cold</i>; and
cold is from ac-ol-id <i>to be without sun</i>; glorifying or ag-lo-ri-fying,
<i>the doing of an high action in an extensive place</i>; gnaw or
ag-in-w, <i>the acting in of an animal</i>; grass or ag-ar-as, <i>the
action upon the ground</i>; place or p-la-ce, <i>a part of the earth’s</i>
extension; property or pe-or-pe-er-ty, <i>entity or possession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>

<i>the sight shut</i>; sky or is-kay, <i>the covering of below</i>; slack or
is-al-ack, <i>a low or slow action</i>; small or is-am-il, <i>the rays of
the sun about below</i>; snail or si-in-na-il, <i>it is in without light</i>;

<h3>ARTICLE.</h3>

<p>The article, αρθρα, partakes of the nature of pronouns;
and in apposition or concord with another name, either
active or substantive, determines it to be a substantive, or the
name of a substance, with its identity and number.</p>

<p>There are two sorts of articles, viz. <i>the</i> and <i>an</i>; an becomes
<i>a</i> or <i>any</i> before a consonant, and either of them being placed
in apposition to an active convertible name, convert it into a
substantive, as <i>to form</i> into <i>a form</i>, <i>to chase</i> into <i>a chase</i>. And,
names being first formed in the plural number, both these
then stood as signs of the singular number; but since plural
names have been taken as singular, and new signs have been
added thereto to form plurals, <i>the</i> is also put in apposition to
plural names, to indentify the person or thing meant or
spoken of.</p>

<p>Example; Some may still imagine <i>the</i> signification of <i>an</i> article
or <i>a</i> letter, and perhaps more compound names to be indefinable,
and the article to be useless; tho’ <i>the</i> definitions
here given thereof evidently shew <i>the</i> contrary; and the Greeks
and Romans not only made use of the genders ο, η, το, and
hic, hæc, hoc, but also of a declining article at the end of
nouns, as the Welsh did <i>un</i> and <i>yr</i>, which last before a
consonant sunk into y <i>the</i>, inflecting with the following radical
consonant; and other nations have made use of the article.
<i>To</i> dispute the utility of the article seems therefore absurd,
but it may be <i>a</i> dispute, whether either determine <i>any</i>
particular individual, or only some third person alluded to,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
pointed at, meant or spoken of in discourse, or in the line of
possession; ο, η, το, hic, hæc, hoc, this, that, yr, un, le,
ein and der expressing as much.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Of Nouns Substantive.</h3>

<p>A Noun Substantive denotes a substance, as a spirit, an
animal, a vegetable, or any other thing that may be conceived
to subsist, as <i>agreeableness</i>, <i>agility</i>, <i>acceleration</i>; which,
tho’ their qualities, <i>agreeable</i>, <i>agile</i>, <i>accelerate</i>, are indefinite
or indeterminate, yet by the signs, <i>ness</i>, <i>ty</i>, <i>ion</i>, signifying
substances, properties, and the sun’s motion, acquire such a
determinate meaning as to become substantives, and to shew
their meaning without being joined with any other word.
And all names, whether of substances, qualities, or other
things, to which the articles <i>an</i> or <i>the</i>, or any other substantive
signs are joined or set in apposition, are nouns substantive.</p>

<p>There are in the English language more substantive names
than seem to be necessary for an universal language, besides
the synonymas of various other dialects, which are incongruous
in sense, with the hieroglyfic signs, and tend to darken
and confound the natural sense and sounds of names and
things. Tho’ the English vocables are explained elsewhere,
we shall here take notice of some peculiarities of that nature in
the English substantives.</p>

<p>Bl-ab, b-abe; ebb, gl-ebe; rib, tr-ibe; kn-ob, gl-obe;
t-ub, t-ube; where the final <i>e</i> should be dropped, and the
remaining vowel marked with a grave accent, as tub, tùb.</p>

<p>B-ack, b-ake; b-eck, b-eke; l-ick, like, link; p-ock,
p-oke, m-uck, p-uke. These might be wrote as lic,
lìc.</p>

<p>Ax, sex, ra-dix, ox, ux, as acs or ach as formerly.
Ach, be-ach, spe-ech, st-ich, l-och, n-och, touch.</p>

<p>M-atch, l-etch, itch, b-otch, sm-utch.</p>

<p>H-ac, ar-se, ace, dice, d-oce, d-uce.</p>

<p>H-ag, l-eg, g-ig, l-og, h-ug.</p>

<p>Age, b-adge, coll-ege, edge, se-ige, br-idge, d-oge,
l-odge, subterf-uge, b-udge.</p>

<p>Aight, eight, f-ight, f-ought, o-ught. These eight last
classes are made use of to express the three subsisting sorts of
actions, viz. the local or inanimate, the generative and energic,
when the first might be expressed by c, the second by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
g, and the third by ch, as, ac, àc, and aç with a cedille,
that is, the acute, the grave, and soft or feminine; ag, àg,
āg for the short, long, and soft of the generative species of
motion; and ach, àch, and āch, the last to be sounded like
the Welsh ch or the English <i>wh</i> in what or where, for the
acute, grave, and gutteral of energies and animal motions;
so that these three letters, which the Welsh inflect so as to
express the cases and genders by the difference of acute,
grave, and gutteral, might very well serve for all the uses of
the eight last classes of names, should the whole be deemed
necessary. But, those of the third, fifth, eighth, and
ninth classes are compound sounds expressed by a combination
of characters, which ought not to be kept together but
in terminations; they having been corruptly introduced into
languages by the Greeks and Romans, in order to express
qualities and pleasant sounds contrary to the nature of
things.</p>

<p>Bre-ad, bl-ade, br-ed, br-eed, ma-id, si-de, c-od, c-ode,
b-ud, pr-ude, should be wrote and accented as ud, ùd.</p>

<p>St-af, st-ave, be-ef, be-eve, l-ife, ol-ive, beho-of, beho-ove,
c-ave, might be made staff and stàf, as formerly.</p>

<p>An-im-al, male, h-ell, h-eel, circ-le, Apr-il, v-ill,
b-ile, car-ol, par-ole, c-ull, b-ull, m-ule, might be wrote
and accented al, àl, el, èl, il, ìl, not eel, ol, òl, ul, ùl;
or as the Welsh and Spanish aspirate ll.</p>

<p>H-am, l-ame, sarc-asm, anth-em, th-eme, apoth-egm,
cla-im, cl-ime, quiet-ism, wisd-om, h-ome, mikrocosm,
ch-um, h-ume, usm. Here the final e might be dropped,
and the Greek compounds have no particular meaning;
all being alike expressive of the forms of substances and
things.</p>

<p>Me-an, m-ane, g-ang, p-en, obsc-ene, chall-enge, p-in,
p-ine, th-ing, mo-ti-on, t-ong, b-un, b-ung. These
signify various existences and things, and are properly accented;
but the final e might be exchanged in writing, for
the grave accent, màn.</p>

<p>Attend-ance, abstin-ence, prov-ince, sc-once, d-unce.
These may do as to orthography and accent, and signify
the ens or essence of various things, as, ance of earthly substances,
ens those of water, ince of things in general,
once of motion, and unce of man, as in dunce or di-unce a
privative of the human essence.</p>

<p>Ant, ag-ent, m-int, f-ont, h-unt, signify the possession
of the earth and water or property, properties in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
general, the property of motion and human property, that is
of hunting or driving to and fro in the possessions.</p>

<p>G-ap, g-ape, sle-ep, p-eep, tr-ip, tr-ipe, h-op, h-ope,
s-up, d-upe, shap, ship, shop. Here the grave accent
might serve for the final e; the meaning thereof being the
division generally of matter into substances or parts, except
the terminations shap, ship, and shop, signifying from high
or high.</p>

<p>Cell-ar, c-are, be-er, p-er, or pear, f-ir, fire, clam-or, st-ore,
c-ur, cens-ure, am-our or am-ur, here the final e might be
dropped; and ar signifies upon, àr earth, er since, èr water,
ir high or to, ìr fire, or from, òr an extension of possession,
or a circle, ur or wr a man.</p>

<p>Lam-as, ass, g-aze, ash, be-ast, actr-ess, sque-ese, fl-esh,
ap-ish-ness, apt-ness, ch-est, bl-iss, s-ize, f-ish, l-ist, m-oss,
d-oze, osh, c-ost, b-uss, f-uze, bush, b-ust, might be all
expressed and accented as, as, às, ash, ast to express the
affirmations and energies of affections, properties, and
things.</p>

<p>P-at, p-ate, p-et, def-ete, b-it, b-ite, kn-ot, m-ote,
c-ut, mute, p-ath, t-eeth, fa-ith, m-oth, mo-uth. These
express the identity and property of different parts or things,
and the final e might be exchanged for the grave accent.</p>

<p>Abili-ty, agili-ty, ami-ty, du-ty, antipa-thy, apa-thy,
sympa-thy. These signify different general properties and
qualities of things.</p>

<p>Aristocra-cy, oligar-chy, ordina-ry, mason-ry, orator-y,
lecher-y, grocer-y, orthodox-y, ha-y, ho-y. The cy and
chy signify different qualities, and the y is the Welsh
<i>the</i>.</p>

<p>Ma-w, me-w, mo-w, and s or es for substantives of a
plural nature. This w signifies different springs.</p>

<p>Substantives are distinguished by grammarians into appellatives
or general names of things common to many individuals,
as <i>man</i>, <i>river</i>, <i>month</i>, <i>wind</i>; and proper names, appropriated
only to individuals, as, <i>George</i>, <i>Britain</i>, <i>London</i>,
<i>October</i>, <i>Libs</i>, which admit of neither articles or plurality of
numbers. But all words, excepting one or an, according to
their natural meaning seem to me to be appellative and
capable of being applied to things of a plural nature, were
their primitive sense understood, as for instance, <i>George</i>,
which originally signified <i>a chief of the circle nation</i>, as an appellative
name of a magistrate, in the same manner as King,
Prince, Duke, or any other; but when its original meaning
was lost, and it came to be adopted as a Christian name by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
different families, it was thence supposed to be a mere arbitrary
term, imposed as the name of an individual; and so as to
Britain, London, October, Libs, Thames, Avon, which
were originally appellatives or common expressions for <i>the sea
coast</i>, <i>long towns</i>, <i>the eighth month from the spring</i>, <i>the west
south-west, or Libian wind</i>, <i>the limits of the Iceni</i>, and
<i>Rivers</i>. So that these names, so long as their original meanings
were understood, were as much appellative or common
expressions, as man, river, month, wind, or any other common
names, and as capable too of a plural or singular sense, in
concord with the articles or demonstrative pronouns; as, <i>a</i>,
<i>the</i>, <i>this</i>, or <i>that</i>, chief of the circle nation or long town, &amp;c.
Hence the distinction of common and proper names seems to
be frivolous and unnecessary.</p>

<p>All substantives were originally appellative and plural, and
the articles and demonstrative pronouns were set in apposition
or as terminations thereto, to determine their singular nature
as well as the identity of the individual. But as they are
now mostly understood as the signs of single things, the English
method of adding s or es as a plural termination, should be
generally followed as the best method; unless substantives
and their articles should be restored to their original sense and
use; but in either case the particles, an or en, as terminations
of plural names, when the sense will admit of their being singular,
and en does not express the male and female of the
same kind, as men does both man and woman, seem to be
improper. Nor is it best so to continue the use of such plurals,
as mice, lice, teeth, feet, geese, but rather mus, lus, toth,
fot, gus, which are so in their nature, as expressing the little
eaters, the little family, the grinders, the movers and the
water nation. It is however certain that the numbers of
nouns are in their nature but two, singular and plural, one
and two or many, but whether they are expressed by one or
an, and two or as and es seems not to be very material, tho’
as and es were the primitive signs, as, <i>as</i> signified the
masculine gender, and <i>es</i> the feminine. And numbers and
genders ought to be the same.</p>

<p>There were originally no other distinction of genders of
nouns than the masculine and feminine, and which were distinguishable
only by the signification of vocables; and whatever
other arbitrary modes and distinctions as to genders of
nouns and their declensions or inflections have been arbitrarily
made by other nations, the English still in fact adhere to the
original masculine and feminine genders, the only distinction
of nature, <i>as</i> and <i>es</i>; for were the meaning of substantives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
precisely understood, they would all appear to be either masculine
or feminine, at least, as relative to man and woman,
or according to their active and passive, or hard and soft sounds.
Nor do the English adjectives or pronouns vary as to genders,
numbers, or cases, as has been supposed; but naturally agree
in concord, without any variation or inflection thereof, from
their primitive state.</p>

<p>Indeed if the Welsh modes of inflection derive their origin
from the original language, which was musical, and vocables
could be reduced to their true primitive state, perhaps it might
be the best way, but as that might be impracticable or too
arduous a task, we may as well stick to our old English
voices, which deviate so very little from the primitive
language.</p>

<p>And, as to any variation of cases or the declension of nouns,
the English still remains in the primitive state of language
without any; their prepositions being fully expressive of the situation
and direction of actions and things, and those of other
nations being altogether arbitrary and calculated more for the
sake of variety and preservation of vocables, than from any
necessity, as their prepositions and vocables might in their
primitive state be as expressive, and agree in concord, like
the English, which has no other state or case, than that in
which names were originally formed, or the nominative, as
will appear to any one, that will be at the trouble of a deliberate
consideration of the origin, frame, and construction of
the English language, whatever may have been advanced by
our modern grammarians, as to the variation of the genitive
or possessive case.</p>

<h3>Of Pronouns or general Personates.</h3>

<p>Pronouns, so called from their being supposed to be mere
substitutes of nouns, ought according to their signification
to be deemed either substantives or adjectives; for as general
signs they serve to personate, demonstrate, relate, and interrogate
persons, things, and parts of discourses; and being all
demonstrative and interrogative, they are properly distinguishable
only into the following sorts, viz.</p>

<p>Tho’ the English, Welsh, Greek, and Latin pronouns
are, with the other parts of speech, all defined in the vocabulary
at the end of this essay, it may not be improper here to
observe in general, as to their signification, that the first personal
pronoun substantively, and not substitutionally signifies
man as an indefinite line placed alone or by himself in the centre
of things before his extension or division into <span class="smcapuc">U</span> the male and
female spring; the 2d, the-o-<span class="smcapuc">U</span> or y-o-<span class="smcapuc">U</span>, the <i>off man</i> or woman;
3d, man extended into T, or in his race and possessions;
and hi and shi, the male and female forms and existences;
4th, mankind; 5th, the first and second female persons;
6th, all mankind, persons, and things, except the first second
and third persons singular. The possessives express all
things to be <i>in man</i>, as one universal possessor; and to relate to
his descendents as their qualities and properties. The relative
and interrogative <i>which</i> is a compound of wch-ich signifying
the above action, as <i>ich</i> means the first act of motion or creation,
and uch man’s utmost return of that act or spring upwards.
And so used as a general relative and interrogative of
all actions, as <i>who</i> is of persons, and <i>what</i> of things, and as
to the rest they are particularly explained in the vocabulary.</p>

<p>The personal pronouns and such of the possessives and
relatives as will not join with substantives in construction,
are substantives, and the rest are adjectives; and pronouns
like other English nouns, have no variation or declension
of person, number, gender, or case, but each is an
original, distinct name. So that to attempt any further
distinction of pronouns, like all other unnecessary distinctions,
would tend to the confusion, rather than the illustration of
language, and they perhaps might be better distinguished by
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or their original signification of 1st, 2d, 3d,
persons singular and plural; tho’ such names as have no foundation
in nature, may require more arbitrary rules towards
their explanation.</p>

<h3>Of Nouns Adjective and Participle.</h3>

<p>Adjective and participle nouns are <i>added</i> to substantives
and propositions, as expressive of the attributes or qualities,
affections, and accidents of things, as in the following example;
The <i>preying</i> beast was <i>daring</i>; the astonished guese are <i>fled</i>,
<i>lost</i>, or <i>stolen</i>; and he is still <i>pursuing</i> a fled, lost, or stolen gus,
in order to make a <i>sweet</i> morsel of its garbage; but all such
sensations are <i>nauseous</i> to human nature. But qualities were
originally expressed by the verbal actives, with few particles,
and the compounded sorts were adjected thereto.</p>

<p>And qualities being the effects of light, heat, and motion,
flowing upon, warming or penetrating bodies differently modified
in various degrees, and the sensations thence produced
in us, as those of colours, tastes, sounds and feeling,
rather than any internal offences or properties of matter or substances,
adjectives assert or express their subsistence as the
attributes of various substances and things, as the following
specimen of English adjectives shews.</p>

<p>There are no adjectives terminating in b except <i>ib</i>, which
signifies life to beings, as in glib <i>liquid</i>, and bib to <i>drink</i>;
for ab, eb, ob, ub, signifying from or out of life, would be
improper to express life to things, as descending upon, and
penetrating them, so as to give them motion, growth, generation,
and sensation. Nor is there any adjective terminating
in the letter p, it being expressive only of the parts of matter,
as divisor of a, e, o, and t.</p>

<p>Ac, ec, ic, oc, uc, and their softer inflections, are expressive
of the different modes of motion, as local, generative,
and energic actions and their contraries, as in, weak, <i>our
action</i>, black, <i>shut from the light</i>, slack and lag, <i>a low or
earthly action</i>, meek, <i>a feminine action</i>, epic, <i>an action past</i>, like
<i>the first action of light</i>, high, <i>man acting</i>, light, <i>its active property</i>,
coasting, <i>acting along the edge or lower part of the possessions</i>,
big, <i>a thing swoln with heat</i>, nigh, <i>acting in</i>, mock,
<i>the motion of the cheek</i>, strong, <i>the property of the sun’s motion
below</i>, much, <i>the upper parts</i>.</p>

<p>Ad, ed, id, od, ud, signify an addition and division of qualities
emanating on men, animals, and substances of earth
and water, as in bad, <i>an earthly life</i>, broad, <i>an addition of
country</i>, dead, <i>matter without the addition of quality</i>, sad, <i>a
low addition or quality</i>, glad, <i>that of being high</i>, mad, <i>the addition
of being dumb</i>, or, <i>a brute</i>, red, <i>a diminution of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
colour of light</i>, aged, <i>a past or diminished action</i>, cold, <i>the passive
quality of being deprived of the sun’s action</i>, blind, <i>deprived
of animal light</i>, mid, <i>dividing the center of existence</i>, insipid, <i>a
thing deprived of the internal taste</i>, arid, <i>the earth deprived</i>,
calid, <i>deprived of a covering from the heat</i>, tid, <i>property diminished</i>,
acid, <i>deprived of action</i>, acrid, <i>depraved action of fire</i>,
wild, <i>deprived of volition</i>, odd, <i>deprived of or out of the circle of
possession</i>, ward, <i>the spring or the division of man and woman</i>,
rude, <i>the privation of truth</i>, crude, <i>a rude action</i>.</p>

<p>Af, ef, if, uf, with the inflections ave and ive, affirm the
various state and situation of men and things in life, as, deaf,
<i>he is deprived of sense</i>, safe, <i>he is standing</i>, slavish, <i>he is low</i>,
brave, <i>he is a warm or spirited being</i>, chief, <i>he is the first</i>,
active, <i>it is the property of action</i>, dative, <i>he or it is giving to</i>,
accusative, <i>it is acting at us</i>, abusive, <i>he is from us</i>, captive,
<i>he is taken</i>, abortive, <i>he is from the border of possessions</i>, adjective,
<i>it is cast to</i>, gruff, <i>he is an angry man</i>, bluff, <i>he is an hairy
man</i>.</p>

<p>Al, el, il, ol, ul, express the qualities of earth and water,
as to the parts of extension and place, the ilation of the sun’s
light thereon, all extension and human intelligence, as in,
actual, <i>upon or in the state of action</i>, aerial, <i>in the state of air</i>,
adverbial, <i>in the state of an adverb</i>, real, <i>upon the return of
matter</i>, usual, <i>upon the state of us</i>, genial, <i>in the state of generation</i>,
bestial, <i>upon the property of the lower beings</i>, annual, <i>upon
the return of the year</i>, able, <i>from hell</i>, or <i>being deprived of
light</i>, ample, <i>an extensive place</i>, genteel, <i>the first race</i>, level, <i>the
place of the female extension</i>, single, <i>acting in a place</i>, little, <i>an
extension of the rays of light</i>, agile, <i>the acting light</i>, chill, <i>without
light</i>, civil, <i>a race living together</i>, evil, <i>privation of light</i>,
idle, <i>about a place</i>, oll or all, <i>a circle extended</i>, whole,
<i>man’s place of action</i>, full, <i>man enlightened</i>, artful, <i>the light of
man upon properties</i>, dull, <i>without human light</i>.</p>

<p>Am, im, om, um, are expressive of the different forms,
modes, and existences of the circumambient bodies, as lame,
<i>the mode of crawling</i>, warm, <i>man covered about</i>, dim, <i>without
extension</i>, firm, <i>the fire about</i>, some, <i>the things seen and sounded</i>,
dumb, <i>an earthly being</i>.</p>

<p>An, en, in, on, un, signify existences of earth, water,
and motion in general, and of man, as, mean, <i>me in earth</i>,
human, <i>an earthly one</i>, sane, <i>sound one</i>, profane, <i>from purity</i>,
clean, <i>an action of light upon matter</i>, ashen, <i>the lower one</i>, oak
being the higher, even, <i>springing</i>, serene, <i>the stars in</i>, divine,
<i>God in</i>, supine, <i>the low and up in</i>, benign, <i>being in</i>,
twain, <i>two in</i>, one or un, <i>the spring or man in</i>, alone, <i>in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
state of one</i>, none, <i>no one in</i>, boon, <i>the food one</i>, wrong, <i>a man
from acting upright</i>, dun, <i>the daily one</i>, young, <i>the growing one</i>.</p>

<p>Ar, er, ir, or, ur, are properties of earth, water, fire,
extension, and human nature, as in clear, <i>the action of light
upon</i>, dear, <i>upon thee</i>, near, <i>the not upon</i>, bitter, <i>the biting
water</i>, eager, <i>water from action</i>, tender, <i>thin water</i>, dire,
<i>he is hot</i>, intire, <i>in possession</i>, sore, <i>from the lower</i>, future, <i>the
man in embrio to be born</i>, pure, <i>a man’s part</i>, immature, <i>too
soon at man</i>.</p>

<p>As, es, is, os, us, affirm the different qualities of mankind
and things, as, base, <i>a low or earthy thing</i>, adverse, <i>a spring
downwards</i>, diverse, <i>a divided spring</i>, worse, <i>a low man</i>, aguish,
<i>it is from a spring</i>, apeish, <i>he is a son</i>, wise, <i>he is man</i>, actuose,
<i>it is all active</i>, close, <i>it is all shut</i>, globose, <i>it is all round
as a ball</i>, jocose, <i>it is all joy</i>, noise, <i>it is all nose</i>, as voice is
all vocal, or the sound of the cheeks, upish, <i>he is up</i>, abstruse,
<i>from our property</i>, astonish, <i>it is the tone of an ass or brutes</i>,
babish, <i>that of a baby</i>, copious, <i>a copy of man</i>, ingenious,
<i>internally generated in us</i>.</p>

<p>At, et, it, ot, ut, with their inflections and compounds
signify property or in possession and existence, as, great, <i>the
action of fire at or upon the possessions</i>, last, <i>upon the lowest possession</i>,
agast, <i>acting upon the lowest possession</i>, past, <i>a thing in
the lowest possession or existence</i>, vacant, <i>a thing without possession
or property</i>, radiant, <i>a division of rays upon the possessions</i>, sweet
and secret, <i>female properties</i>, absent, <i>without possession or
property</i>, agent, <i>acting in possession</i>, fit, <i>it is property</i>, apt,
<i>a proper thing</i>, first, <i>the fire of life to the lower possessions</i>, instinct,
<i>in action within</i>, white, <i>the upper property</i>, or <i>the firmament</i>, hot,
<i>the action of the sun on things</i>, absorpt, <i>without a part of the
circle of possession</i>, both, <i>man and woman</i>, moist and most,
<i>things on the ground</i>, abrupt, <i>from the earth up into the possessions</i>,
just, <i>the property of mankind</i>, curst, <i>a man’s action of the lower
property</i>, occult, <i>actions without the property of light</i>, ancient,
<i>one first in possession</i>, decent, <i>fair in possession</i>, acute, <i>a springing
property</i>.</p>

<p>Y, ly, ty, thy, are expressive of properties, existences,
and qualities generally, as in, any <i>the one in action or possession</i>,
many, <i>the more in action or possession</i>, dry, <i>the thing without water</i>,
airy, <i>the air</i>, ashy, <i>the ash</i>, barrenly, <i>the barren race</i>, brotherly, <i>the
brother race</i>, happy, <i>the hap</i>, holy, <i>the high all</i>, sappy, <i>the
sap</i>, forty, <i>the four tyes, times, rounds or tens</i>, swarthy, <i>the
men of lower property</i>, wry, <i>from upright</i>; and thus are definable
all other English, Greek, Welsh, and Latin adjectives.
These have been taken at random, and the Greek and Latin
terminations of adjectives being all in as, es, eis, os, òs, oos,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
ous, us, on, and er, are mere affirmatives, by the sight,
sound, spring, and motion of things.</p>

<p>So that adjectives and participles are names, which imply
assertions and attributes, as those of qualities, affections, and
properties of substances and things generally; but making
no compleat sense, nor determining any particular thing
without being joined to another word as <i>a daring</i>, <i>a daring
man</i>. In the English language they are not varied in respect
to genders, numbers, cases, or otherwise, except as to the
degrees of comparison.</p>

<p>The three degrees of comparison mentioned by grammarians,
are the positive, comparative, and superlative; the
positive is the state in which the name was originally put;
the comparative is formed by adding <i>er</i>, a spring beyond the
original state, to the quality, where they will agree in concord,
as, deep, <i>deeper</i>, <i>deepest</i>, high, <i>higher</i>, <i>highest</i>, sweet,
<i>sweeter</i>, <i>sweetest</i>; <i>est</i> signifying a spring beyond the limits of
the possessions; forming the superlative degree; but where those
syllables will not so agree with the names and in participles,
as in <i>aerial</i>, <i>ingenious</i>, <i>copious</i>, <i>daring</i>, <i>loving</i>, <i>loved</i>, the comparative
must be formed, by setting <i>more</i>, that is, mo-er a great
spring, in apposition to the name; and the superlative by
the addition of <i>most</i>, signifying a spring beyond the limits of
the possessions.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Of Prepositions</h3>

<p>A Preposition is a substantive part of speech set before other
names, most commonly substantives, either in apposition,
as, <i>before a noun</i>, or in composition, as, <i>preposition</i>, to denote
the situation or place of action, or rest of the things, to
which they are joined; at the same time implying their similar
relations or kindred; and connecting the names of substances,
as, <i>from</i> this book, <i>with</i> the pen of the writer; or
<i>from thence</i>, it may be inferred that prepositions are of themselves
significant of things. But the use of prepositions or
the names of cases are best understood from the following explanation
thereof.</p>

<p>It is observable that O is an universal expression for the circle
of motion and extension; that i signifies a perpendicular
line or man placed in its center; and that this line, with a
traverse one, expressed by <span class="smcapuc">T</span> or ⊥ and signifying mankind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and other beings and things as extended, and the properties
of man denote the nominative case, or that in which they
were first named; and all the other cases, as they happen
upon, up or down, or to or from either of these lines, are
distinguished as in the following example.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/prepositions.jpg" width="600" height="325" alt="A spatial diagram of prepositions" />
</div>

<p>These prepositions are definable as follows.</p>

<p>In, with, within, to, into, unto, at, towards. In, signifies
man placed in the center of existences, as a middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
being, partaking of, and connecting matter with spirit; with
is the spring of i into male and female, and <span class="smcapuc">T</span> their possessions
inflected; within is the same in the circle of possession: to
is <span class="smcapuc">T-O</span>, the property of motion from <span class="smcapuc">T</span> to the circle of motion;
into the same within the possessions; unto, at, and
towards, the same towards man or the line of possession;
afore, before, against, signify things or parts in and out of
the borders of possession.</p>

<p>After, behind, since, according to. After is off <span class="smcapuc">T</span> or the
border of possession; behind is to be after man in possession;
since, having been in possession; according to, agreeing together
in acting; between, betwixt, among, amongst, for,
from, about; for, the parts or things of the circle of possession;
about and from the parts or things within the circle
of possessions of men; between and betwixt, the line i dividing
the possessions; among and amongst, the things about the
circle of possession. Above, up, on, upon; above, the upper
spring of the human sight; up, the spring part, on and
upon the sky.</p>

<p>Under, below, beneath, down. Under, not sprung within
or up the possessions; down, not sprung in; below, from
being up; beneath, to be not in possession.</p>

<p>Out, of, from, out of, without. Out, from the possessions
of men and things; of, the things within the borders;
from, the surrounding parts therein; without, out of possession.</p>

<p>By, through, over, over and above, besides, beyond, except,
until. By, the part; besides, below the part; beyond, by
the upper covering; thro’, from the possessions; over, from
the spring of sight; except, acting out of the possession part;
until, during the spring or possession of light; the two last
names serve also for conjunctions.</p>

<hr />

<h3>CONJUNCTIONS.</h3>

<p>A Conjunction is an active part of speech, that connectively
or disjunctively joins together words and sentences,
as the names of actions, as prepositions do those of substances.
They have been divided by grammarians into various sorts;
tho’ the only significant distinction seems to be into copulatives,
connectives, and disjunctives, as the two former sorts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
absolutely connect and coalesce both the sentences and their
meaning, or when the expression is only of mere local or inanimate
motion, barely move on, connect, and continue the
sentence or discourse, without any compatibility of meaning;
and the latter sorts conditionally, exceptionably, or interrogatively
do the same. Of the first class are, and or ond, <i>on
in division or discourse</i>, but, <i>be it as or by man and things soon</i>,
yet, <i>it is or springs</i>, also, <i>on so</i>, likewise, <i>the same way</i>, still,
<i>light on things</i>, altho’, <i>upon to</i>, notwithstanding, <i>not opposing
the former action</i>, however, <i>be the spring of action as it may</i>,
nevertheless, <i>without any spring</i>, as, <i>the earth seen</i>, as well as,
<i>its surface or under it out of sight</i>, for, <i>the part in the circle</i>,
therefore, <i>the parts and spring within the circle</i>, wherefore,
<i>the parts in which circle</i>, because, <i>by our own actions</i>, that,
<i>towards possession</i>. And the disjunctives are the following;
or, <i>the promiscuous things within the circle of possession</i>, either,
<i>action or matter</i>, nor, <i>not the things promiscuously within the circle
of possession</i>, neither, <i>no action or rest</i>, till or untill, <i>during
the spring of light on the possessions</i>, whilst or while, <i>the action of
the upper light on the possessions</i>, if, <i>life or is it life?</i> unless, <i>my
spring out</i>, except, <i>acting from the parts of possession</i>, besides,
<i>by the side</i>; and with which sense the Welsh, Greek and
Latin conjunctions correspond, as appears by an analysis
thereof at the end of this essay.</p>

<p>An example of their use and construction.—Was it pride
<i>and</i> folly, <i>or</i> avarice and envy, that caused the confusion of
human speech? It was <i>neither</i> the one or the other, <i>but</i> the
effect of some supernatural cause, <i>as</i>, the scripture informs
us. <i>Nor</i> is it probable, that so great a deviation could have
naturally happened; <i>unless</i> there was some very great wilful
perversion of the original language, <i>whilst</i> mankind were
contending for possessions <i>as well as</i> power. <i>Nevertheless</i> the
first language is <i>still</i> recoverable, <i>notwithstanding</i> its many divisions
and great disguise, <i>if</i> the subject be adverted, after a
right method. And <i>altho’</i> it may be <i>also</i> attended with some
labor to mankind, <i>except</i> those already skilled in languages,
<i>yet</i> it may be attained by any English reader, that will endeavour
it, <i>for</i>, <i>however</i> languages may differ, as to the manner
of combination or construction of names and sentences, they
are certainly one and the same in their principles, and <i>likewise</i>
in their particles; <i>because</i> the letters and particles of all languages
appear by this essay to be still the same. <i>Besides</i>, as human
speech derives its origin from a supernatural cause, its
various dialects cannot differ as to their materials. <i>Wherefore</i>
then so many different opinions concerning these matters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
<i>but</i> from our own remissness? Let us <i>therefore</i> exert our faculties
in the laudable undertaking of recovering the first
universal language, <i>that</i> we may be thereby restored to our
senses, which seem to be equally perverted.</p>

<hr />

<h3>VERBS.</h3>

<p>Verbs are either simple or compound. The simple are
those springs or energic signs in human speech, which,
mark the relation and connection of the subject and attribute
of a proposition; and affirm or deny the agreement or disagreement
betwixt things, as, man <i>is</i> an animal. Compound or
concrete verbs also include adjectives and participles; or the
qualities and attributes of the subject of a proposition, as,
man <i>thinks</i> or think is; sometimes only the subject, as <i>mae</i>,
<i>eimi</i>, <i>I am</i>, or <i>sum</i>; and frequently the subject, affirmation
and attribute, as, <i>walketh</i>, man is upon action. In
some dialects verbs have been so modified, as to denote or imply
the modes, times, persons, genders, and numbers of the
things affirmed; and nominally distinguished, as verbs active,
passive, neuter, personal, impersonal, regular, irregular,
auxiliary, and substantive; tho’ according to their real use
and signification, all verbs seem to be substantive and auxiliary,
and either singly, or conjunctively, with adjectives
or participles, formed into attributive or compound verbs, express
all modes of actions and affirmations, as appears by the
following instances; sum, I am, or, <i>it is man’s existence</i>, es,
the second person created or the feminine gender, est, the
second, first, and a third person born of the first and second,
fui, <i>I have lived or been</i>, fuisti, <i>thou hast lived or been</i>, fuit, he
the person born, hath lived or been; amo, I love or <i>am for
a woman</i>, the first person, amas, the feminine the second
person, amat, the third person produced, the third person,
am-avi for ui in fui, <i>he has loved or been loved</i>, the past tense;
doceo, I teach or <i>give the lowering action to man</i>, the first person,
doc-es, the second person or feminine gender, doc-et the
third proceeding from the other two, doc-ui, as in fui, I have
lived or been taught, the past tense; lego I read or <i>recall</i>,
the first person, leg-is the second, leg-it the third, and leg-i,
<i>man read</i> the past; audio, I hear, or, <i>spring the passive sense</i>,
au-di-is, au-di-it and au-di-vi, I have lived or been heard;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and the conjugating particles seem to be the degrees of comparison,
as, a, e, i, or as, es is, male, female, mankind,
or earth, water and fire, or motion and existences in general;
and the persons of <span class="smcapuc">U</span> <i>man</i>, and thence all things of the masculine
gender the first person, as, es, or is signifying the feminine
in different degrees and qualities, the second, and at, et,
it, the rest of mankind and things, the third person, am-us,
em-us, im-us, all men of the male kind of the first person
plural, atis, etis, itis, all except the first person singular of
the second, and ant, ent, int, all mankind and things in different
degrees, except the first and second person singular,
of the third person plural; and thus may be explained all the
Latin and Greek modes of conjugating verbs.</p>

<p>Verbs are farther distinguished by grammarians into active,
passive, and neuter, as being expressive of actions, passions,
or neither the one or the other, but mere being or existing,
as, <i>I love</i>, <i>am loved</i>, <i>live</i>, <i>walk</i>, <i>or stand</i>; tho’ according to
the signification of words, there does not seem to be any real
ground for the latter distinction, for <i>to love</i>, <i>to be loved</i>, <i>to
live</i>, <i>sleep or rest</i>, must signify either actions, active passions
and energies, or their privation and passiveness. So that the
distinction in this respect might be more properly made into
active and passive only, agreeable to the masculine and feminine,
the only proper distinction of nouns as to genders; all
actions, substances, and things, at least, as having relation to
mankind, being either masculine or feminine, and the distinctions
made by the Greeks and Romans being mostly arbitrary
and contrary to the meaning of words which ought to
determine the genders of nouns.</p>

<p>Verbs have a designation of person, corresponding with the
personal pronouns; of number with the singular and plural of
nouns, of tenses as representing present, past, and future actions
and things; and of modes or the manner in which
they ought to be expressed. But whatever necessity there
may be for a great variety of modes and tenses in dialects,
constructed upon arbitrary principles, it does not appear that
any more than one is needful for a natural language, or that
the modes of conjugating verbs or any other, are in fact expressible
by human speech any otherwise than by the whole
form or order of inflection and things. And tho’ present,
past, and future, seem to be necessary expressions, according to
our present mode of conception, yet they are not in reality
any representation of time, but of our manner of dividing
or reckoning the changes of motions or number of
actions in extension, which in the eternal state of spirits, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
perhaps in a vacuum, might be deemed as one intire action or
the present tense.</p>

<p>Simple verbs or affirmatives are all substantive and incapable
of being inflected themselves, but serve as auxiliaries in
the affirmations and inflections of compound verbs, tho’
alone, without the assistance of compound verbs sufficient to
express every mode of affirmations, of actions and things, and
fully correspond with the nouns and pronouns, as for instance,
<i>I am doing</i>, <i>have done</i>, <i>may</i>, <i>can</i>, <i>will</i>, <i>shall</i>, <i>must</i>, or ought
to do; thou, <i>art doing</i>, hast done, &amp;c; he, she, a man, or,
John <i>is doing</i>, <i>hath done</i>, <i>speaks</i>, <i>speaketh</i>, &amp;c. We <i>are</i> or
<i>were doing</i>, <i>have done</i>, &amp;c; besides, <i>id</i>, <i>ed</i>, with their inflections
ith and eth, and also <i>is</i>, added as affirmations in the
third person singular to compound verbs; which express attributes,
affirmations, and persons, and sometimes the subject
and number, tho’ the number is commonly implied by the
noun or pronoun. In the following specimen of conjugating
verbs, the persons, number, and actions or tenses are expressed
by different words, with very few variations of terminations.</p>

<p>The feminine or endearing inflections of the second persons
<i>thou</i> and <i>ye</i> have been omitted, as needless, since they all
agree with the pronouns <i>you</i> and <i>ye</i>, and the only changes
are from are and be to <i>art</i> and <i>beest</i>, have to <i>hast</i>, were to
<i>wert</i>, shall and will to <i>shalt</i> and <i>wilt</i>, and might to <i>mightest</i>, and
do to <i>dost</i>; but to make use of them in the masculine gender,
would be depreciating it. And the participle perfect, being superfluous,
it has been likewise omitted; for as <i>ing</i> the present is
compleat, so is <i>ed</i> for the past or the privative of springs or actions.</p>

<p>The signification of the conjugating verbs in the four languages
is as follows, viz. 1. Am, mae, ειμι, sum, <i>in full
form of existence</i>; be, fi, φυω, fio, <i>I live</i>; can, dichon,
δυναμαι, possum, <i>in act</i> or able to act; may, amhay, ωμει,
sim, <i>about acting</i>; would, could, should, might, ought,
buasun, ειην, essem, <i>the will or act sprung or past</i>; shall, will,
must, byddaf, εσομαι, ero, <i>the lower acting up, the spring
of human light, the lower things sprung up</i>; was oeddun, ῆν,
eram, <i>man or spring past</i>; have been, bum, ῆμην, fui, <i>acted
in life</i>. 2. Are, ere, or art, beest, wit, or idwit, εις, es,
<i>the lesser spring, and it is the spring of life</i>. 3. Is, it is, fi, id,
idiu, εστι, est, <i>it is seen, sounded, smelt</i>, &amp;c; hath, <i>it acts</i>;
had or ha-ed, <i>action past</i>; hadst, <i>a female action past</i>; do or
dost, <i>motion past</i>. 4. Are, ym, εσμην, sumus, <i>men in the
spring</i>; were, buasom, εμεθα, eramus, <i>men sprung</i>. Let,
bydd, εστο, esto, <i>extend</i> or take thy place; to be, bod,
ειναι, esse, <i>the property of motion to beings</i>, which converts
substantives into adjectives; ing, <i>in action</i>; it is not, nid,
ουκ εστι, non est, <i>there is no motion</i>.</p>

<p>All English verbs which vary from this mode of inflection
being erroneous and irregular, ought not to be established
by grammatical rules, but restored to the primitive state in the
present tense, and marked in the past tense with the proper
accent; or if it should appear to be necessary, to add proper
conjugations. But as verbs lose their qualities or active state
in the past tense, the English verbs ending in d and t in the
past tense, have been very properly diminished and substantived,
and accordingly contracted in their sounds, of ed to that
of d and t, as taught from teached, when the ch was accented
hard, and a like the German a or o, felt for feeled, checkt
for checked, slept for sleeped, left for leaved, gilt for gilded,
bled for bleeded, fed for feeded, had for haed, fed for feeded,
fled for flyed, sold for selled, and such others as are so contracted
without any other variation, that are capable of a past
tense, except, <i>let</i>, <i>put</i>, <i>do</i>, <i>think</i>, and other imperatives,
which can form no perfect past tense, without the aid of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
auxiliary verb <i>have</i>, to express some degree of human energy
or return to the creative fiat. And as all other tenses seem to
be arbitrary and indefinite, the best way of expressing the
minuter divisions of actions must be by adverbs or numerals.</p>

<p>And as there is no sort of foundation or necessity for the
participle perfect, the best way of correcting those verbs which
are supposed to be irregular therein, would be to drop it as
superfluous, and fully as well expressed by the past tense, as
help, helped, without holpen, cleave, cleaved, or cleft, instead
of cleave, clave, clove and cloven, hang hanged, for
hang hung. And as to the forming a regular past tense,
by reducing irregular verbs to their primitive state in the present
tense, the following may perhaps be no improper observation,
viz. <i>all</i> in fall, before the corrupt sound of the northern
a, as that of o, was, as it ought to be, accented, like
<i>ale</i> in pale, and marked with a long accent, as signifying <i>from
high</i>; its past tense accented short, as <i>all</i> in shall; and
wrote <i>fall</i> and not fell; the e not having then taken the place
of a, nor a, that of o; shake, signifying <i>a passionate action of
a subject</i>, is properly accented and wrote in the present tense,
but its past tense having partaken of the northern accent, it
then came to be wrote and accented <i>shook</i>, instead of <i>shaked</i>,
which, notwithstanding its long establishment by vulgar custom
ought to be rectified accordingly; and so as to swear,
heave, freeze, abide, strike, dig, and various other instances,
where the e has assumed the place of a, a of o, o of a, e, i,
or u, of i, or any other change of vowels from the present,
to form the past tense; except such as <i>do</i> and <i>did</i>, which are
different words, and of themselves incapable of any inflection.
And the English terminations <i>an</i> and <i>en</i>, borrowed from the
northern dialects, add nothing to the meaning of our names,
but the English, or Engli-Saxon names, are of a southern or
Celtic origin, and as fully expressive of the meaning to which
they are applied without them; except where they are added
to form the singular number, or to active names as substantiving
articles, as in all other Celtic dialects.</p>

<hr />

<h3>ADVERBS.</h3>

<p>Adverbs are certain energic or active particles or <i>additional</i>
verbs added to, or joined with other names in
propositions, to denote the degrees and manner of things, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
to quantity, situation, quality, motion, and rest. Of quantity,
as less, lesser, least, much, more, most, great, greater, greatest,
long, longer, longest, short, shorter, shortest, broad, broader,
broadest. Of situation or place, as where, whither? up,
down, above, below, high, higher, highest, here, there,
yonder, far, farther, farthest, within, without, upwards,
downwards, forwards, backwards, and such as are expressive
of the situation of bodies in motion, or at rest. Of qualities,
as wisely, knowingly, sensibly, decently, likely, fairly,
warmly, foolishly, beastly, coldly, hardly, and such as
express intentional qualities. Of motion and rest; as comprehending
affirmatives, interrogatives, interjectories, and those
improperly called adverbs of time, as, when? now, anon,
then, yesterday, to-day, to-morrow, henceforwards, ever,
never, how often? often, oftener, oftenest, once, twice,
thrice, seldom, however, away, begone, adieu, speedily,
slowly, verily, yes, yea, no, why, however, perhap, alternately,
as, alack, ha, alas, ho, oh.</p>

<p>There are no other sorts of adverbs, expressive of the order,
time, or manner of things, as appears by the definition of
those of the four languages in the vocabulary; nor does it
thence appear that there is in fact above three sorts of adverbs,
namely, quantity or extension or bulk of bodies; quality
or an illation of light, heat and motion thereon, and penetrating
the same, expressed by <i>ly</i>, as <i>ty</i> does extension in substantiving
qualities; and motions energic, animate, and local,
with the contraries, as privation, rest, and matter. And
the degrees, like adjectives, are compared by adding <i>er</i> and <i>est</i>,
as comparative and superlative, to the positive or the state or
degree of beings and things in act, or putting <i>more</i> or
<i>most</i> in apposition thereto.</p>

<p>The degrees of distance and situation, are reckoned like
prepositions, upon lines, upright, across, or slantways, extended
from the centre of action or existence in our system
where man is supposed to stand; or upon man as a mikrocosm
standing up with arms extended; his head representing the
unseen celestial system, being the superlative degree upwards,
the extent of his sight or the sky, the comparative, his body
or the world, the positive, upwards, downwards, and crosswise,
his limbs below the parts of generation, as representing
the parts below the earth’s surface or growth part, the
comparative downwards, and beyond it the superlative, the
extent of view, the comparative sideways, and beyond it the
superlative, as appears by the definition of Adverbs in the vocabulary.
And tho’ interjections are supposed to add nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
to the sentence, they certainly express the sorts and degrees of
energy with which the whole is affirmed.</p>

<hr />

<h3>SYNTAX.</h3>

<p>Having thus explained the several parts of a rational
grammar, it now remains only to lay down some general
rules for their construction, into simple and compound
sentences, according to their natural concord, government,
and arrangement.</p>

<p>All the parts of speech, which were originally only particles
of one or two letters, having naturally coalesced and
united, in more complex names, and words or propositions,
without the assistance of art, so in all languages, like the
English, in which respect both the simple and complex
names still retain their primitive state, without any loss of
their natural powers of construction, by any arbitrary addition
or combination of artificial signs or modes of concord,
like the Greek and Latin, the parts both simple and complex
being precisely understood, will still be governed by their
meaning, and naturally coincide in sentences, in the same
manner as the ideas of a person unacquainted with the artificial
rules of logick, are by their natural relation logically
connected and formed into regular thesises, hypothesises and
synthesises. As for instance; a person, who perfectly knows
the meaning of the parts, can in his mind form and express
the following sentences; two and two of any thing are, <i>is</i> or
is to be sounded four, and not three; and should they happen
to be horses, whether with or without shoes, they must
be the horses of some man, rather than those of a cow; but
if they are delivered, in whatever place they stand, it must be
to and from some place, and by and to some body, or if they
should only be called, it ought to be done by their right
names. Or; supposing Adam, <i>i</i>, or any one know myself
or himself to be the first man, inhabiting space, and that his
length and breadth of extension, was at all times or upon all
motions, and as much more, as he or i might by the extension
of the arms acquire, without dispossessing another, were
our own property, i might, as the first existence and proprietor
here of the kind, call myself the first, one, or i. If I
had a wife and a son, who had a wife and a son, and had
been taught to tell seven in English, with their precise meaning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
I might as my next relation, as well as the second person
in existence, name my wife two or thou, my son, as the
third in being and possession, I might name he, him, or
three, which make up the number of the singular stock; and
as to the plural number or stock, the first and second person of
the singular, and the son which sprung from them, with his
son being four in number, and the first spring of the second
stock might be named <i>we</i>, as the first person plural; the two
wives <i>ye</i>, the second persons plural of the kind or genders;
and all other persons excepting those of the singular number, as
the grandson and his offspring, the sixth person from the first
or the third in the second generation or plural number, <i>they</i>.
Then if the first man or any other perfectly understood the
meaning of all other names and energies, which appear to be
as equally related to the nature of things as these, he could
have no difficulty of putting them together according to true
concord, as the meaning and signification would not permit
him to err; nor indeed is the English to be taught by any
other significant rules. The parts of speech being precisely
understood, the best way then of acquiring the right English
construction, is carefully to observe the manner and
style of the best English writers, and to procure an habit
thereof by reading and writing, rather than be perplexed
by innumerable tedious and unmeaning rules of phrases,
sentences, distinctions, and variations of names, from their
natural order; for which there is no sort of foundation in
the English, or any other language of nature.</p>

<p>But since the English language is that here proposed as
an universal one, it may not however be improper to take
some little farther notice of the rules of English Syntax. In
all languages to form a right sentence the words must agree in
construction with one another, as to case, number, gender,
and person, either according to the natural order of things, or
some arbitrary mode of concord and government, by a variation
of the terminations substituted in lieu thereof in particular
languages. But the English doth so only from the sense
of the words, without any variation of terminations, except
that es or s signifying the feminine gender, is sometimes added
to form the plural number of substantives, and the substantive
verb <i>is</i>, or the pronouns <i>it</i>, <i>with</i> its inflections, to
form the third person singular of verbs, and as and es in some
instances, to express the masculine and feminine genders.</p>

<p>And though it has no other case but the nominative, or any
variation of cases at all, yet all English verbs agree with the
substantives in number and person, without any exception;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and the state or situation of substantives are expressed by prepositions
set in apposition thereto in the same manner as the
articles; nor have the adjectives any variations, besides the
degrees of comparison; and yet both they and participles
agree with the substantives in gender, number and case; and
when two substantives of different sorts of things come together,
the place, state, or case of the last is expressed by the
preposition <i>of</i> or-’s, signifying <i>of his</i>; unless the latter substantive
is of the same sort with, or explains the former; in
which case they are both of the same case, state, or situation.
Conjunctions, adverbs, and relatives, serve to connect sentences,
as prepositions do words. The relatives <i>who</i>, <i>what</i>,
and <i>which</i>, and all other English names as well as things,
must agree with the antecedents as their originals, whether
persons, actions, or substantives. When two verbs come together,
the latter is to be in the infinitive mode.</p>

<p>Some sketches of the creation, the original and present state
of men and animals in our system of beings, the fall of man
and other obscure scenes of antiquity, have been drawn from
the sacred characters made use of by the Priests and Druids to
preserve their original, ancient and secret knowledge, in
order to illustrate the present subject, and setting the present
confused, deluded, or enchanted state of language and knowledge
in a right course and direction. But the press not admitting
of their being exhibited in that order and mode,
which seemed to be necessary for a compleat transmission of
the sacred hieroglyfics, the following specimen must suffice
for the present.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/hieroglyfics.jpg" width="600" height="300" alt="10 clusters of hieroglyphics, as described below" />
</div>

<p>1. The state of man previous to the formation of Eve and his essential modes.
2. His compound state or the nonessential modes and division into parts and
actions. 3. Emblems of concupiscible appetites, innate parental traces, energies
and passions acquired by the fall. 4. The state of man and woman after the
fall, as enchanted and confined to place or matter. 5. The Serpent, an emblem
of speech. 6. A theta instead of the Coptic kei, an emblem of man’s primitive
state, &amp;c. 7. Birds; but the round <span class="smcapuc">U</span> is made use for the Coptic e. 8. Beasts
and Bulls. 9. Fishes. 10. Twigs and trees. But more of this hereafter.</p>

<p>And as all letters are thus deriveable from the parts of man, resembling all
other things, Adam might be very well instructed, in their use in paradise;—And,
the divisions of time appear to have been made from the days of the creation. See
the former treatise.</p>

<p><b>Transcriber’s Note:</b> Changes made to the text to correct probable
printer errors are listed below. 1760s spelling remains unchanged.
Greek ligatures (and mid-word ϛ) have been modernised to separate
letters (and στ). Greek letters were occasionally printed reversed
or upside down, probably because the typesetter wasn’t familiar with
the alphabet, and this has been corrected without further note.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
